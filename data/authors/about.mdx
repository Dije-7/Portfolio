I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in Data Science, as well as a variety of other fields. 
In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm also passionate about finance, business, and entrepreneurship. 
I believe that the combination of these interests and skills gives me a unique perspective and a valuable set of tools to tackle the complex challenges of the modern digital landscape.
Outside of the technical realm, I love playing and watching football, playing video games, and exploring the world through travel and photography. 
These hobbies help me recharge my batteries and keep me inspired to take on new challenges and explore new horizons.

Overall, I am deeply committed to pursuing my passions and expanding my horizons in the field of technology.
I'm excited to continue exploring new technologies, developing innovative solutions, and contributing to the growth and success of businesses and organizations.
Whether you're interested in learning more about my technical expertise, discussing potential collaborations, or simply sharing your own experiences and insights, I'm always happy to connect and engage with like-minded individuals.
