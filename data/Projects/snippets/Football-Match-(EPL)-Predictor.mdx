# About the Project

This project involved predicting the winner of football matches in the current season of the English Premier League (EPL) using a machine learning model called the Random Forest Classifier. To train our model, we scraped data from the past 5 years of all EPL matches, which included various features such as team names, match dates, scores, and other relevant statistics.

We then used the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions, to predict the winner of the current season's matches based on historical data. The model takes into account various factors such as team performance, recent form, and home and away advantage to make predictions.

This project can be useful for football fans, enthusiasts, and even for betting purposes. By predicting the winner of upcoming matches, we can provide valuable insights into the likely outcomes of the matches and help fans make informed decisions.

### Project Steps

* Scrape match data using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.  
* Clean the data and get it ready for machine learning using pandas.
* Make predictions about who will win a match using scikit-learn.
* Measure error and improve our predictions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrated the use of machine learning to predict the winner of football matches in the current season of the English Premier League (EPL) using historical data from the past 5 years. We used the Random Forest Classifier algorithm to make predictions based on various features such as team performance, recent form, and home and away advantage. The project can be useful for football fans and enthusiasts, as well as for betting purposes.

In terms of future scope, there are several areas where this project can be improved. One approach would be to incorporate more features such as player statistics, weather conditions, and other external factors that may affect the outcomes of the matches. This can help improve the accuracy of the predictions and provide more valuable insights into the outcomes of the matches.

Another possibility is to explore other machine learning algorithms such as neural networks or gradient boosting methods, which may provide better performance than the Random Forest Classifier. Additionally, the project can be extended to include other football leagues and tournaments from around the world, providing more opportunities for football fans and enthusiasts to engage with the sport.

Overall, this project is a good starting point for predicting the winner of football matches using machine learning, and there is a lot of potential for further development and improvement. By incorporating more features and exploring different algorithms, we can improve the accuracy of the predictions and provide more valuable insights into the sport.
