# About the Project

This project is a Python script that uses the Yahoo Finance API v7 as its data source to retrieve real-time stock market data for a list of stock ticker symbols. The script first reads in a list of stock ticker symbols from a text file, and then uses the Yahoo Finance API to query and retrieve the latest market data for each symbol.

Once the data has been retrieved, the script displays the real-time stock prices and other important information such as the daily percentage change, volume, and market capitalization for each stock on the terminal. The output is presented in a user-friendly format, making it easy to monitor the performance of your stocks in real-time.

This project is useful for investors and traders who want to keep track of their portfolio and monitor the performance of their stocks in real-time. It can help users make informed decisions about buying or selling their stocks based on the latest market data.
